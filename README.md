## Udacity Neighborhood Map: Project 5

This project consists of implementing Google Maps API on page along with three other API's that coherently and seamlessly function as a web application.
I decided to create my own API that holds a list of Winery's in Napa Valley, CA. 
Along with creating my own API I included WeatherUnderground API and Foursquare API.
